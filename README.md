# Integrating Living Organisms to Implement Care-based Interactions
This repository contains 3D models, vector cuts, and schematic/PCB design files to replicate the slime mold integrated smartwatch presented in the paper "Integrating Living Organisms to Implement Care-based Interactions", which appeared at UIST2022.

## Device Hardware
The slime mold integrated smart watch is a standard maker-friendly smartwatch with a display, RTC, and heart rate sensor. However, it's specifically engineered to rely on the slime mold to form a conductive wire. An overview of the whole system can be seen below.
